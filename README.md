## Hi there 👋






**Hey! I'm Shubham, welcome to my GitHub page.**


I design and build web apps , cross platform mobile apps and scripts for automation .


I'm keeping my personal projects private at the moment since my progress on them is slow going. I'll definitely share them when I have MVPs ready, for now they're just for my own learning and enjoyment :)


My main tech stack is Next.js, typescript, tailwind, better-auth and postgres for web. 


I use Expo/React Native for cross platform app development.


I’ve got a bunch of scripts, automation and internal tooling which are written in python and golang.


Hobbies: anime, gaming, building things !


The vibe :relax, write some code, be a black coffee(btw) drinking nerd, and enjoy life !
